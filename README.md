# Classification of Brain Tumor

Brain Tumor MRI images have been classified into 4 classes by using Transfer Learning Models. The classes are-

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma tumor
- Pituatary tumor
- No tumor
  <br><br>
  
Currently, the model is trained without data augmentation. <br>In the future, data augmentation will be used on the training images to enhance the metrics.
